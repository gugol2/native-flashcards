# Native Flahscards

Mobile app built with React Native and Redux for Android and iOS, that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those deck and get the score once a quiz is finised.

## Instalation

1. https://github.com/gugol2/native-flashcards.git
2. cd into native-flashcards
3. yarn install
4. expo start

With these commands you will run the expo packager and will be able to launch the app
on a device emulator or on a real device.
To run the code on a real device:

1. Install the expo app from google play for Adroid or the market for IOS.
2. Scan the QR code that you get prompted on the terminal with the expo app.

## Platforms tested

This application has been tested on an Android real device (Android 9.0). I couldn't test it on an iOS platform (nor emulator nor real device).
